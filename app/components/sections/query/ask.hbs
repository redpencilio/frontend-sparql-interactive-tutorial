  <h3><code>ASK</code> Query</h3>
</header>

<p>
  The
  <code>ASK</code>
  query serves to check whether your dataset conforms to the provided
  conditions. Instead of returning data, it returns a boolean depending on
  whether the provided triple patterns were successfully matched or not. This
  can be especially useful for exploring your data, to gain insights into what
  kind of relations exist.
</p>
<p>
  An
  <code>ASK</code>
  query has the following syntax
</p>

{{!-- prettier-ignore --}}
{{!-- <pre><code>PREFIX foaf: &lt;http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/&gt;
PREFIX mo: &lt;http://purl.org/ontology/mo/&gt;

ASK {
  [a mo:MusicArtist] foaf:made [a mo:Release] .
}</code></pre> --}}
<Yasgui @defaultQuery={{this.exampleQuery}} @readOnly={{true}} />

<p>
  In this case, we're asking if there exists any music artist who has made a
  record.
  <code>ASK</code>
  queries are generally faster than
  <code>SELECT</code>
  queries. Notice the new syntax using the square brackets
  <code>[]</code>. This syntax lets us define
  <em class='italic'>blank nodes</em>, which act like variables but that cannot
  be referenced. A possible alternative writing of the pattern would be
  <code>
    ?artist a mo:MusicArtist. ?artist foaf:made ?release. ?release a mo:Release.
  </code>, but since we're not interested in the value of any of these
  variables, the blank node notation lets us shorten our pattern by quite a bit.

  <p>
    Let's find out if there are any artists who are based in Belgium with the
    name "Blackwave". Make sure to use the
    <code>ASK</code>
    query for this!
  </p>
  <Hint>
    You can use the
    <code>foaf:based_near</code>
    property to find out where artists are based.
